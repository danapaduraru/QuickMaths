## If you want to play the game...

- You need to change the absolute path to *user-file.txt* according to the place you saved the project here:
  - line 25 in *QuickMaths.java*
  - line 45 in *UserFile.java*
- You can change the number of exercises in each round using the variable *exercise_count* in *Exercises.java* on line 62
- The commands I use for running the application are:

```
cd D:\PROJECTS\Java\QuickMaths\src
javac quickMaths\QuickMaths.java
java quickMaths.QuickMaths
```
